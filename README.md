# Scrape--WeatherData
Scrape historical weather data by using BS4 and Selenium
Our team needed the historical weather data to build a machine learning model to predict air pollution concentration. And it should be free data because this is for a research project. 
I used the combined method of bs4 and selenium to write a program which can automatically download any time range for data from any weather stations and then combine them to a big file.
